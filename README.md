Hello all,

In this project I am trying to predict the fares of the flights in India. The datast has been taken from the below:

I have started with data preprocessing, which was a major hurdle since there are so many fields that need to be processed to get the data in a usable format.

Since this is a regression problem, I have then trained various machine learning models such as Linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression and finally Random Forest regressor.
